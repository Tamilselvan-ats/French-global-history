00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.090
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) From prehistory to our days, France has gone

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.270
through centuries of evolution, conflicts and discoveries.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.950
On this European territory, Celtic tribes have left

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.850
room for a powerful medieval kingdom, before becoming

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.129
the modern nation that we know today.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.710
France, of art, of science and of freedom,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.190
has profoundly marked the world by its culture

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.990
and its ideas.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.850
In this video, we will travel through time

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.690
to discover how this country has transformed, how

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.830
it has grown and how it has inspired

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:36.570
entire generations.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.150
Welcome to the global history of France, a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.970
fascinating journey to the heart of the past,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.090
from the Middle Ages to the contemporary era.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.200
This territory was already inhabited by ancient peoples.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.300
About a million years ago, the first humans

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.660
came to earth, which we now call France.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.520
Its first inhabitants lived in caves, hunted to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.780
survive and used stone to make their tools.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.800
Alaska, Chauvet and Millau, incredible ruptured paintings bear

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.280
witness to their lives, their beliefs and their

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.980
imaginations.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.620
These works, over 17,000 years old, show

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.660
bison, horses and deer, symbols of the nature

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.340
that surrounded them.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.260
Little by little, prehistoric men learn to master

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.880
fire, to make clothes and build stronger shelters.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.340
Then, a decisive change occurs, man becomes sedentary.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.760
During the Neolithic, peoples began to cultivate the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.340
earth and raise animals.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.420
Villages are formed, tools become more refined and

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.340
pottery appears.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.220
This transition from a nomadic life to a

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.100
stable life marks a silent revolution in the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.120
history of humanity.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.920
It was also at this time that the

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.360
mysterious megalithic monuments emerged, such as those of

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.680
Carnac, in Brittany.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.940
Alignments of giant stones, drawn with fascinating precision,

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.180
whose exact meaning remains a mystery.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.160
Were these places of worship, observatories or symbols

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.900
of the link between men and the stars?

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.080
Towards the end of prehistory, new peoples settle.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.220
The Celts.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.580
Organized into tribes, they develop a rich culture

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.000
made of warriors, druids and talented artisans.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.720
They love the forces of nature, worship trees

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.060
and rivers and form powerful and hierarchical societies.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.960
Their villages, called Opida, become the first fortified

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.100
centers of what will be, ten years later,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.860
Gaul.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.120
Prehistory comes to an end when Rome, the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.500
most powerful empire in the ancient world, turns

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.140
its gaze west, towards this country of forests,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.880
rivers and warriors, Gaul.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.820
Thus ends the long prehistoric night and opens

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.500
a new chapter.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:00.400
Only, France enters history.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.020
After the end of the Roman Inquiry, Gaul

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.520
enters a new era, the Middle Ages.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.880
In the 20th century, a people from the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.560
North imposes itself.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.620
The Franks.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.480
Their king, Clovis, unifies the tribes and founds

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.900
the Merovingian dynasty.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.800
By converting to Christianity around the year 500,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.680
Clovis gives birth to a lasting alliance between

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.940
the monarchy and the Church.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.080
This moment marks the real beginning of France.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.220
After Clovis, the Carolingians take power.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.460
The most famous of them, Charlemagne, reigns over

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.340
a huge empire.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.840
He encourages education, culture and religion and dreams

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.380
of bringing back the greatness of Rome.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.380
His coronation in Rome in the year 800,

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.080
by Pope Leon III, symbolizes the birth of

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.820
a new Christian empire in Europe.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.420
But after his death, his empire is divided.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.060
The invasions begin again.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.820
Vikings from the North, Saracens from the South,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.900
Hungarians from the East.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.340
Fear and insecurity mark this era.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.340
It is then that feudalism is born.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.360
A system where the lords protect their lands

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.880
and their vassals in exchange for loyalty and

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.380
service.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.720
Strong castles are built everywhere, symbols of power

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.680
and defense.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.640
The peasants, they, work in the fields, often

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.900
living in poverty, under the protection of their

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.200
lord.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.860
Medieval life is hard, but also deeply spiritual.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.480
Monasteries become places of knowledge and prayer.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.600
The monks copy the ancient manuscripts there and

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.280
preserve the knowledge of the ancient world.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.700
Thanks to them, culture survives through the centuries.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.840
From the 11th century, France is transforming.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.860
The islands grow, trade is reborn, and a

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.240
new class of merchants appears.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.560
At the same time, the kings seek to

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.480
strengthen their power.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.620
Philip Auguste enlarged the kingdom, built the Louvre

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.200
and founded the University of Paris.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.700
Saint Louis, just and pious king, becomes a

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.200
symbol of wisdom and faith.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.420
But the Middle Ages is also the time

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.040
of crusades.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.960
Thousands of knights leave for the Holy Land,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.500
driven by faith and the desire for glory.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.580
These expeditions deeply mark Europe and open roads

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.320
to the East.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.280
In the cities, cathedrals rise to the sky.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.240
In Paris, Notre-Dame becomes the jewel of

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.420
the Gothic style, symbol of the Christian soul

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.220
of the Middle Ages.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.900
However, this era is not without drama.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.700
In the 14th century, the Black Feast ravages

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.740
Europe, killing millions of people.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.160
Then, the Hundred Years' War breaks out between

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.120
France and England.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.720
For more than a century, the kingdom is

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.520
torn apart.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.400
In this chaos arises a heroine, Jeanne d

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.660
'Arc.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.100
Young girl from Dongrémy, she hears voices ordering

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.160
her to save France.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.200
At the head of the armies, she gives

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.360
hope to a whole people and allows the

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.400
coronation of King Charles VII in Reims.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.280
Captured by the English, she is judged and

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.980
burned alive in Rouen in 1431.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.140
But her courage and her faith make her

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.880
an eternal legend, symbol of resistance and freedom.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.480
At the end of the Middle Ages, France

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.040
comes out weakened but united.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.640
The kings regain control of the country, the

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.880
cities prosper, and a new era is announced.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.040
The Renaissance.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.500
After centuries of faith, wars and chivalry, the

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.760
Middle Ages ends, leaving behind the foundations of

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.400
a powerful kingdom, a common language and a

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.300
new identity.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.350
A new era begins, the Renaissance.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.150
Inspired by the arts and sciences from Italy,

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.510
France transforms.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.930
Kings like François I encourage artists, architects and

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:26.370
writers.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.910
It is the time of the Châteaux de

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.390
la Loire, of humanism and great discoveries.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.330
Printmaking spreads, ideas circulate faster, and knowledge becomes

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.870
a force.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.070
Léonard de Vinci himself finds refuge in France,

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.590
a symbol of this openness to culture and

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:43.010
progress.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.770
But the country also knows dark times.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.450
Religious wars break out between Catholics and Protestants,

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.710
dividing the nation for nearly a century.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.850
The massacre of Saint Barthélemy in 1572 remains

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.770
one of the most tragic episodes of this

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:59.070
period.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.550
In 1598, King Henry IV ends the conflict

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.950
by proclaiming the Edi of Nantes, which guarantees

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:06.790
religious tolerance.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.110
He restores peace and begins the reconstruction of

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.550
the kingdom.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.790
Then comes the 17th century, the century of

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.150
King Louis XIV.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.210
He embodies absolute monarchy.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.590
Since his palace in Versailles, he centralizes all

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.010
the power in his hands and makes France

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.850
shine throughout Europe.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.270
Under his reign, arts, literature and architecture know

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.850
an unprecedented flash.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.950
Molière, Racine, Lully and the Nôtre make the

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.810
Court a center of culture and prestige.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.710
But this greatness has a price.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.370
The people impoverish themselves and wars ruin their

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.750
kingdom.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.210
In the 18th century, the Enlightenment appears.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.290
Philosophers such as Voltaire, Rousseau and Montesquieu question

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.330
the established order.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.890
They talk about freedom, justice and equality.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.770
Their ideas spread throughout society and announce a

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:57.730
major upheaval.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:02.770
This upheaval breaks out in 1789, the French

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:02.870
Revolution.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.650
The people rise up against injustice and start

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.350
a monarchy.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.370
The Bastille falls, the Declaration of Human Rights

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.610
is proclaimed and a new war breaks out,

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.690
that of freedom and citizenship.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.770
But the revolution is also marked by violence.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:21.030
Terror ensnares France before an ambitious man emerges,

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:22.690
Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.250
General Briand takes power in 1799 and is

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.430
crowned emperor in 1804.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.470
He reforms the administration, law and education and

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.030
conquers a large part of Europe.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.730
But after years of war, he is defeated

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.690
in Waterloo in 1815.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.670
The 19th century sees alternate empires, republics and

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.230
monarchies.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.270
Industrialization transforms the country, the iron roads extend

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.270
and Paris becomes a modern capital under Haussmann.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.470
Finally, in the 20th century, France faces the

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.850
two world wars, knows resistance, liberation and gradually

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.070
builds the democracy we know today.
